# Frontend

Initially built via the nx workspace generator, `npx create-nx-workspace@latest npx create-nx-workspace@latest frontend --preset=react-monorepo`:
- app name redish
- bundler webpack
- no e2e test runners
- scss stylesheets
- no distributed caching (nx cloud)

## Module federation

We are making use of [Nx | Module Federation Support](https://nx.dev/concepts/more-concepts/faster-builds-with-module-federation).

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve redish --open`. This will open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

To start host and remotes in dev mode, run `nx serve redish --open --devRemotes="games-worm"`. This will allow you to develop on your host app and your remotes simultaneously, instead of serving static versions of remotes from cache (as explained [here](https://github.com/nrwl/react-module-federation) for a similar setup).

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

or at https://nx.dev/react-tutorial/1-code-generation.

### Create module-federation host app

`nx generate @nx/react:host --name=redish --directory=apps/redish --e2eTestRunner=none --projectNameAndRootFormat=as-provided --style=scss --typescriptConfiguration=true --unitTestRunner=none --no-interactive`

### Create module-federation remote app

`nx generate @nx/react:remote --name=games-worm --devServerPort=4301 --directory=apps/games/worm --host=redish --e2eTestRunner=none --projectNameAndRootFormat=as-provided --routing=true --style=scss --typescriptConfiguration=true --unitTestRunner=none --no-interactive`

### Create lib

`nx g @nx/react:lib redish-ui --directory libs/redish/ui`

### Create component

`nx g @nx/react:component redish-header --project redish-ui`

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
